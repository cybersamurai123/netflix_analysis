# üì∫ Netflix Content Analysis Using SQL

## üéØ Objective

To explore, analyze, and derive insights from the Netflix content catalog using SQL. The aim is to understand content distribution by type, rating, release trends, top actors and countries, and keyword-based classification to assist business decisions and viewer insights.

## üß© Problem Statement

With thousands of titles, Netflix‚Äôs global content library is vast and diverse. This project analyzes Netflix's dataset to uncover patterns such as content type distribution, popular ratings, country-specific production, trending genres, and actor appearances. Understanding such data can help content teams decide on regional content strategies, popular genres, and audience preferences.

## üìä Methodology

1. Created the `netflix` table and imported data.
2. Executed 15 business questions using SQL to uncover insights.
3. Used data transformation techniques (e.g., `UNNEST`, `SPLIT_PART`) for cleaner analysis.
4. Identified missing values and metadata gaps.
5. Derived insights from genre, cast, rating, duration, and geography.
